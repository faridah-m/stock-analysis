# Overview of the Project 
## Project Background
        This project begun in an effort to understand how actively the stock DQ was traded. We then proceeded to do a greater analysis of the yearly return of all stock tickers across the 2017 and 2018. 

    Project Purpose
        The purpose of this project is to measure the Return across all 12 tickers in the Years 2017 and 2018. The yearly return is the percentage increase or decrease in price from the beginning of the year to the end of the year.
    
        In addition, the project also measures performance via a timer that displays how long it took each query, per year, to run.
